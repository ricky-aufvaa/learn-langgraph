    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Learned:\n",
    "1. **Structured Output**: Using Pydantic models for reliable LLM responses\n",
    "2. **Conditional Routing**: Dynamic graph paths based on user intent\n",
    "3. **Multi-Node Coordination**: Building complex workflows with multiple capabilities\n",
    "4. **LLM Integration**: Working with AWS Bedrock and Claude effectively\n",
    "5. **Intent Classification**: Using LLMs to route between different services\n",
    "6. **State Management**: Handling complex state with multiple data types\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use This Pattern:\n",
    "- **Multi-Service Applications**: When you have different capabilities to offer\n",
    "- **Intent-Based Routing**: When user requests need different processing\n",
    "- **Structured Data Extraction**: When you need consistent, typed responses\n",
    "- **Conversational AI**: When building chatbots with multiple skills\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices Demonstrated:\n",
    "- **Modular Design**: Separate chains for different capabilities\n",
    "- **Type Safety**: Using Pydantic for structured responses\n",
    "- **Clear Separation**: Distinct nodes for different processing types\n",
    "- **Robust Routing**: LLM-based intent classification\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for unclear intents\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Pitfalls to Avoid:\n",
    "- **Wrong Return Format**: Nodes must return state update dictionaries\n",
    "- **Missing State Fields**: Ensure state includes all needed fields\n",
    "- **Poor Prompts**: Unclear prompts lead to inconsistent routing\n",
    "- **No Fallbacks**: Always handle edge cases in routing logic\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- **Notebook 3**: Build simple chatbots with LangGraph\n",
    "- **Notebook 4**: Add memory and persistence to conversations\n",
    "- **Notebook 5**: Implement SQLite-based persistent memory\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extensions You Could Add:\n",
    "- **More Services**: Add genre classification, book reviews, etc.\n",
    "- **Better Routing**: Multi-level intent classification\n",
    "- **Error Recovery**: Retry logic for failed LLM calls\n",
    "- **Caching**: Store frequent queries for faster responses\n",
    "- **User Profiles**: Personalized recommendations based on history"
