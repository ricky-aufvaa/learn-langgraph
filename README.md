# LangGraph Learning Journey 

> A hands-on exploration from basic state graphs to production-ready chatbots with persistent memory

Welcome to my LangGraph Learn! This repo is where I document my journey through LangGraph concepts, from "what the heck is a StateGraph?" to building chatbots that actually remember our conversations. Think of it as my digital notebook that I can revisit whenever I need to brush up on concepts, and hopefully, it helps you learn too!

## What's Inside? 

This repository follows my actual learning path through LangGraph. Each notebook represents a milestone in understanding how to build stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs.

### Current Notebooks

| Notebook | What You'll Learn | Complexity |
|----------|-------------------|------------|
| **1_stategraph.ipynb** | StateGraph fundamentals, conditional edges, and basic graph compilation | Beginner |
| **2_persona.ipynb** | Structured output with Pydantic, conditional routing, and multi-node coordination | Intermediate |
| **3_chatbots.ipynb** | Building basic conversational AI with MessagesState and LLM integration | Beginner |
| **4_chatbots_memory.ipynb** | Adding memory to chatbots with MemorySaver for session persistence | Intermediate |
| **4_chatbots_sqlite_memory.ipynb** | Production-ready persistent memory using SQLite for real applications | Advanced |

## Getting Started Ô∏è

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Basic understanding of Python and async programming
- Familiarity with LangChain (helpful but not required)
- AWS Bedrock access (or modify for your preferred LLM provider)

### Setup

1. **Clone this playground**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/learn-langgraph.git
   cd learn-langgraph
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up your environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Start exploring!**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## What Makes This Different? 

- **Real Learning Journey**: These aren't polished tutorials - they're my actual learning notes with honest struggles and discoveries
- **Practical Focus**: Every concept is tied to real-world applications
- **Progressive Complexity**: Each notebook builds naturally on the previous ones
- **Production Considerations**: I don't just show you how to build it, but how to make it work in the real world
- **Authentic Voice**: No corporate speak here - just genuine insights from someone figuring this stuff out

## Coming Soon 

This is just the beginning! I'm planning to add:

- **Advanced Patterns**: Multi-agent systems, tool integration, and complex workflows
- **Real Projects**: Complete applications showcasing LangGraph in action
- **Performance Optimization**: Making your graphs fast and efficient
- **Deployment Guides**: Getting your LangGraph apps into production
- **Integration Examples**: Working with different LLM providers, databases, and APIs
- **Debugging Techniques**: What to do when your graph doesn't behave as expected

## How to Use This Repo 

### For Learning
1. Start with `1_stategraph.ipynb` if you're new to LangGraph
2. Follow the numbered sequence for a structured learning path
3. Run the code, break things, fix them - that's how we learn!
4. Check out the "Key Takeaways" sections for quick refreshers

### For Reference
- Each notebook has detailed explanations of concepts and alternatives
- Use the table of contents to jump to specific topics
- Code is heavily commented for easy understanding
- "Where this falls short" sections help you understand limitations

### For Inspiration
- See how concepts evolve from simple to complex
- Understand the reasoning behind architectural decisions
- Get ideas for your own LangGraph projects

**Happy Learning!** üéâ

Remember, the best way to learn LangGraph is by building things. Don't just read through these notebooks - run them, modify them, break them, and make them your own. That's how you'll really understand what's going on under the hood.

*P.S. If you build something cool with these concepts, I'd love to hear about it! Drop me a line or open an issue to share your project.*
