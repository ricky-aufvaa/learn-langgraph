    "# LangGraph Fundamentals: StateGraph and Conditional Edges\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces the core concepts of LangGraph:\n",
    "- **StateGraph**: The foundation of LangGraph applications\n",
    "- **State Management**: How data flows through your graph\n",
    "- **Nodes**: Individual processing units\n",
    "- **Conditional Edges**: Dynamic routing based on state\n",
    "- **Graph Compilation**: Converting your graph definition into an executable application\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is LangGraph?\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs. It extends LangChain's expression language with the ability to coordinate multiple chains (or actors) across multiple steps of computation in a cyclic manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "- **State**: Shared data structure that persists across nodes\n",
    "- **Nodes**: Functions that process and modify the state\n",
    "- **Edges**: Connections between nodes that determine execution flow\n",
    "- **Conditional Edges**: Dynamic routing based on state values"

    "## 2. Defining the State\n",
    "\n",
    "The **State** is the central data structure that flows through your graph. It's shared across all nodes and persists throughout the execution.\n",

    "### Why TypedDict?\n",
    "- **Type Safety**: Ensures your state has the expected structure\n",
    "- **IDE Support**: Better autocomplete and error detection\n",

    "- **Regular Dict**: Less type safety but more flexible\n",
    "- **Pydantic Models**: More validation but heavier\n",

    "3. Return the updated state (or partial state)\n",
